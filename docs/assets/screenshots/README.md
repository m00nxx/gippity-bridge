# Gippity Bridge screenshot evidence

These screenshots are captured from the Docker stack, not static mockups.

## Captured Views

| File | Source | What it proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oss-console-overview.png` | `http://127.0.0.1:8080` | Gippity Console loads from the nginx Docker image, reads API health from `:8000`, shows route capacity, model count, download routes, and operational status. |
| `oss-console-accounts.png` | `http://127.0.0.1:8080/#accounts` | Account capture management is exposed as a first-class console page with ASCII account-name validation, capture inspection, update, verify, and delete controls. |
| `oss-console-docs.png` | `http://127.0.0.1:8080/#api-docs` | Console embeds API route docs with request/response shape guidance, including chat, images, edits, vision/OCR, research, files, admin routes, and cancel routes. |
| `oss-console-library.png` | `http://127.0.0.1:8080/#storage` | The storage/library plane is separated from runtime controls and is ready to show completed images and research reports with download URLs. |
| `oss-console-opencode.png` | `http://127.0.0.1:8080/#opencode` | opencode is configured as a consumer integration, not as the whole product control plane. |
| `oss-game-setup.png` | `http://127.0.0.1:3000` | The character-game use case loads from Docker, sees the local API as online, shows the public browser URL, and is ready to stream the first route only after user action. |

## Re-Capture

Run the stack:

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then capture with Playwright or a browser screenshot tool. Avoid committing
screenshots that expose session cookies, copied captures, bearer tokens beyond
the default `local-dev-key`, or personal account names you do not want shown.
